The T790M gatekeeper mutation in the EGFR kinase domain increases ATP affinity and reduces TKI binding. Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR TKI, was specifically designed to target T790M and received FDA approval for T790M-positive NSCLC after progression on first-line EGFR TKI therapy. Osimertinib demonstrates ORR of 71% against T790M-positive tumors. Liquid biopsy (ctDNA) for T790M detection is FDA-approved and recommended before tissue rebiopsy due to its non-invasive nature and rapid turnaround. The adoption of osimertinib as first-line therapy (FLAURA trial) bypasses T790M resistance but introduces different resistance mechanisms including C797S and MET amplification.",

The clinical impact depends on whether C797S occurs in cis (same allele) or trans (different allele) with T790M. When C797S is in trans with T790M, a combination of first-gen TKI plus third-gen TKI may overcome resistance. When in cis, no single-agent TKI is effective. When C797S occurs without T790M (in the setting of first-line osimertinib), first-generation EGFR TKIs may be effective. Emerging strategies include fourth-generation EGFR TKIs (BLU-945), bispecific antibodies (amivantamab), and EGFR-MET bispecific approaches.
