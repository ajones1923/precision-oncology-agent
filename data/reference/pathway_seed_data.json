Canonical signaling proceeds through receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation of RAS GTPases (KRAS, NRAS, HRAS), which activate RAF kinases (BRAF, CRAF), leading to MEK1/2 phosphorylation and subsequent ERK1/2 activation. ERK1/2 phosphorylates transcription factors driving proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Key therapeutic nodes include BRAF (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib), MEK (trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib, selumetinib), KRAS G12C (sotorasib, adagrasib), and upstream RTKs (EGFR, HER2).
