In the BRIM-3 trial, vemurafenib improved OS compared to dacarbazine (13.6 vs 9.7 months) with an ORR of 48%. Vemurafenib binds the ATP-binding site of BRAF V600E with high selectivity. Common adverse effects include arthralgia, rash, photosensitivity, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (due to paradoxical MAPK activation). Single-agent vemurafenib has largely been superseded by combination BRAF+MEK inhibition (dabrafenib+trametinib, encorafenib+binimetinib) which provides superior efficacy and reduced paradoxical ERK activation. Resistance develops through NRAS mutations, BRAF amplification, and MEK mutations within 6-12 months on monotherapy.",

    "text_summary": "Rucaparib is an oral PARP1/2/3 inhibitor approved for BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer as maintenance therapy and treatment. The ARIEL3 trial demonstrated maintenance PFS of 10.8 months for rucaparib versus 5.4 months for placebo in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, with the greatest benefit in BRCA-mutant (median PFS 16.6 months) and HRD-positive subgroups. Rucaparib was the first PARP inhibitor with an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for detecting BRCA mutations in tumor tissue (FoundationFocus CDx BRCA). The drug has broader PARP family inhibition (PARP1/2/3) compared to olaparib. Key adverse effects include anemia, fatigue, nausea, elevated ALT/AST, and thrombocytopenia. Similar to other PARP inhibitors, resistance develops through BRCA reversion mutations restoring homologous recombination. Rucaparib is being investigated in BRCA-mutant prostate and pancreatic cancers.",

    "text_summary": "Avapritinib is a selective type I kinase inhibitor specifically designed to target the KIT D816V and PDGFRA D842V activation loop mutations that are resistant to conventional type II kinase inhibitors (imatinib, sunitinib). For PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST, the NAVIGATOR trial demonstrated ORR of 88% with median DOR not reached, establishing avapritinib as the standard of care for this previously untreatable subtype. For advanced systemic mastocytosis, avapritinib (PATHFINDER trial) showed ORR of 93% in advSM patients. Unlike imatinib and sunitinib that bind the inactive DFG-out conformation (type II), avapritinib binds the active DFG-in conformation (type I), explaining its unique activity against activation loop mutations. Key adverse effects include cognitive effects (memory impairment, cognitive disturbance), periorbital edema, nausea, and intracranial hemorrhage risk.",

Approved for metastatic TNBC (ASCENT trial: median PFS 5.6 vs 1.7 months, OS 12.1 vs 6.7 months) and HR-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (TROPiCS-02 trial), sacituzumab govitecan represents a major advance for patients with limited targeted therapy options. Also approved for urothelial carcinoma. Trop-2 is broadly expressed across epithelial cancers, making this platform potentially applicable to many tumor types. The bystander effect from SN-38 release provides activity even in heterogeneously Trop-2-expressing tumors. Key adverse effects include neutropenia, diarrhea, nausea, and alopecia. UGT1A1*28 homozygosity increases toxicity risk.",

Also approved for HER2-positive gastric cancer (DESTINY-Gastric01) and HER2-mutant NSCLC (DESTINY-Lung02). The bystander killing effect from membrane-permeable DXd enables activity in heterogeneous tumors.
