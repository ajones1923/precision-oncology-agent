This evidence led to the FDA approval of pembrolizumab for TMB-H solid tumors regardless of histology. The trial enrolled over 1,000 patients across cohorts including cervical, endometrial, biliary, SCLC, mesothelioma, neuroendocrine, and salivary gland cancers.

    "text_summary": "TAPUR (Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry) is an ASCO-sponsored phase 2 basket study matching FDA-approved targeted therapies to patients with advanced cancers harboring genomic alterations known to be drug targets, used outside of their currently approved indications. The study includes multiple cohorts with drugs including pembrolizumab, olaparib, trastuzumab, sunitinib, palbociclib, osimertinib, and others matched to molecular alterations. TAPUR operates pragmatically in community oncology settings and has enrolled over 4,000 patients across 1,500+ sites. Key findings include activity of pembrolizumab in TMB-high cancers across multiple histologies, palbociclib in CDKN2A-altered tumors, and sunitinib in KIT-mutant cancers. TAPUR generates real-world evidence on biomarker-drug combinations and has supported FDA labeling discussions. The trial demonstrates that precision medicine can be implemented at scale in community oncology practice.",
