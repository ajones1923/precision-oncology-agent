CDKN2A encodes both p16INK4a and p14ARF, which regulate the RB and p53 tumor suppressor pathways respectively. Loss of p16INK4a removes an important CDK4/6 inhibitory checkpoint, leading to unchecked cell cycle progression. CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib) are being investigated in CDKN2A-deleted tumors beyond breast cancer. In mesothelioma, CDKN2A deletion detected by FISH is a diagnostic marker distinguishing malignant mesothelioma from reactive mesothelial proliferation. CDKN2A deletion is prognostic and associated with aggressive clinical behavior across multiple tumor types.",

STK11 mutations are enriched in KRAS-mutant NSCLC and define a subset (KRAS/STK11 co-mutant) with particularly poor immunotherapy outcomes. STK11 loss leads to dysregulation of AMPK signaling, resulting in metabolic reprogramming and mTOR activation. The KEAP1/STK11 co-mutation pattern in NSCLC is associated with the worst prognosis. Emerging strategies for STK11-mutant tumors include STING agonists, metabolic intervention with metformin analogs, and combination immunotherapy approaches.

APC mutation status is relevant for FAP screening and genetic counseling. Emerging therapeutic approaches include tankyrase inhibitors that target downstream WNT signaling and beta-catenin degraders.
