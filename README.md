# Precision Oncology Agent

**Closed-loop precision oncology CDSS — from VCF to MTB packet**

Part of the [HCLS AI Factory](https://github.com/your-org/hcls-ai-factory) platform.

---

## Overview

The Precision Oncology Agent is a RAG-powered clinical decision support system
designed to accelerate molecular tumor board (MTB) workflows. Given a patient's
somatic and germline variant calls (VCF), the agent identifies actionable
variants, matches them against curated oncology knowledge bases, ranks
candidate therapies, surfaces relevant clinical trials, and assembles a
structured MTB-ready report — all within minutes on commodity hardware.

The agent ingests evidence from CIViC, OncoKB, ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed,
and NCCN/ASCO/ESMO guidelines into 10 purpose-built Milvus vector collections
plus one shared read-only collection from the upstream genomics pipeline. Every
recommendation is grounded in retrieved evidence with tiered citations so
clinicians can trace the reasoning chain.

Built on the same architecture as the HCLS AI Factory's RAG/Chat pipeline, the
agent uses BGE-small-en-v1.5 embeddings (384-dim), IVF_FLAT/COSINE indexing in
Milvus 2.4, and Claude as the reasoning backbone. A Streamlit UI provides
interactive case exploration, while a FastAPI server exposes programmatic
endpoints for integration with EHR and LIMS systems.

The system is designed to run on a single NVIDIA DGX Spark ($3,999) alongside
the rest of the HCLS AI Factory pipeline, maintaining the project's goal of
end-to-end precision medicine — from Patient DNA to Drug Candidates in under
5 hours.

## Features

- **Variant Annotation** — Automatic lookup of somatic/germline variants against CIViC, OncoKB, and ClinVar with evidence-level tiering (Level 1-4)
- **Therapy Ranking** — Multi-factor ranking of approved and investigational therapies based on variant profile, biomarkers, resistance mechanisms, and guideline concordance
- **Clinical Trial Matching** — Real-time matching against ClinicalTrials.gov based on molecular profile, cancer type, and biomarker eligibility criteria
- **Guideline Retrieval** — Contextual retrieval of NCCN, ASCO, and ESMO recommendations relevant to the patient's molecular and clinical profile
- **Resistance Awareness** — Proactive identification of known resistance mechanisms and bypass strategies for proposed therapies
- **Pathway Analysis** — Cross-referencing of identified variants against signaling pathway maps to uncover druggable nodes and cross-talk
- **MTB Report Generation** — One-click generation of structured molecular tumor board packets with tiered evidence citations
- **Cross-Modal Integration** — Seamless handoff to/from the genomics pipeline (Stage 1) and drug discovery pipeline (Stage 3)
- **FHIR Export** — Export case data and recommendations in FHIR R4 format for EHR integration
- **Scheduled Refresh** — Background scheduler for periodic re-ingestion of CIViC, clinical trials, and literature updates
- **Observability** — Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing, and structured logging via Loguru
